Project for creating a knowledge graph of cybersecurity artifacts mined from Zenodo

Jelena's group has been working on collecting resources/artifacts that are important for cybersecurity. These resources are papers, datasets or software that are related to a cybersecurity topic. Jelena's student has been compiling the table she sent in a manual manner. We would like to speed up the process by identifying which resources in Zenodo are relevant to cybersecurity, their description and how do they relate together and build a knowledge graph allowing Jelenaâ€™s group to efficiently search for related artifacts.
